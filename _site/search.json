    "text": "Top-down controls from Arctic terrestrial herbivores on aquatic biogeochemistry\n\nCollaborators: Ryan Sponseller, Johan Olofsson, Matthias Siewert (Umeå University), Karin Nilsson (Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences)\n\nHere we have been exploring how major Arctic terrestrial hervivores (reindeers, rodents, moths) have the capacity to propagate biogeochemical effects from land to recipient aquatic systems. We are focused on two aspects: one is how the fine-scale landscape use of herbivores overlaps with hydrological connectivity in the Arctic. For example, rodents such as lemmings and voles have a winter activity pattern characterized by making nests in snowbeds, which provide large insulation. The second aspect is to combine monitoring data, large-scale herbivore exclosures, and remote sensing tools to detect biogeochemical signals in aquatic systems that can be related to herbivory in terrestrial ecosystems. For example, rodent and moth outbreaks have a profound impact in terrestrial ecosystems by supressing primary productivity and generating litter, and we are able to detect this signal in the recipient streams and lakes.\nTimeline 2020 – 2023\n\n\n\nExample of two adjacent streams in northern Norway, separated by a large-scale fence that causes high grazing intensity by reindeers in one of the sides"

This will involve some theoretical work as well as some empirical measurements to validate the model, ideally capturing productivity gradients within Europe.\nThis project is funded by a mobility grant from the Swedish Research Council, where I have the opportunity to do a research stay in the Blanes Centre of Advanced Research.\nTimeline 2022 – 2025"

    "text": "I am a catchment ecologist, with a background in modelling and complex systems science. The broad aim of my research is to understand how the movement of energy and matter in landscapes shapes ecosystems in face of climate change, with water as the main vector of connectivity. To do this I combine empirical measurements in ecosystems with quantitative data analysis, modelling and machine learning tools.\nMore specifically, I am interested in landscape patterns of carbon and nutrient storage and flux, the biogeochemical mechanisms that regulate these patterns within and across ecosystems, and how to translate these processes across spatial and temporal scales to understand their broader implications.\nThis website is pretty basic, where you can find my publications, some side projects as well as some software tools I have been using for my research."

This R script can obtain the stream channel just providing a pair of coordinates of a stream. The workflow is as follows:\n\nDownload a high resolution digital elevation model (DEM) around the site, using the package “elevatr”.\nModel the flow accumulation in the landscape to see the stream channels.\nSnap the coordinates provided to the closest stream.\nAn algorithm then follows the stream channel upstream for a predetermined length, and estimates the slope as the elevation difference between the site and upstream divided by the distance.\n\nCode and more details for this is in github.\n\n\n\nAn example of the algorithm working. The black point is the low site, and the red the site upstream. The raster shows the flow accumulation in the landscape"
